#  Netflix Customer Churn Prediction System

##  Project Description

This project addresses the problem of **customer churn** in a Netflix-like subscription-based streaming service using machine learning. Churn (customer attrition) is a major concern for subscription businesses, as retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

By analyzing customer behaviors and attributes â€” such as **watch time**, **subscription type**, **region**, **device**, **payment method**, and **number of profiles** â€” we built a predictive model to identify users who are most likely to churn.

##  Key Objectives

- Understand the **factors influencing churn**
- Clean and preprocess real-world customer data
- Build and compare predictive models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- Visualize churn-related patterns and trends using graphs
- Provide **actionable insights** to improve retention

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** (for visualizations)
- **SQLite** (for structured data storage)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** & `.py` scripts (for implementation)
- **GitHub** (for version control and collaboration)

##  Results

-  Achieved **~88% accuracy** with Random Forest Classifier
-  Identified key churn indicators:
  -	 Low average watch time
  -	 Short account tenure
  -	 Monthly payment plans
-  Visualized behavior patterns:
  - Avg Watch Time vs. Churn
  - Churn by Payment Method
  - Subscription Type Distributions
